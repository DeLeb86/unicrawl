Interventions are developed in consultation with participants, rather than developed in isolation by an expert and imposed upon a passive recipient. Client centred interventions take into account factors such as the interest and intrinsic motivators of the participant as well as their resources \u2013 financial, personal and environmental.\u00a0Evidence-based interventions: requires clinical application of evidence from the disciplines of exercise physiology, biomechanics, motor control and exercise psychology to achieve goals related to health, fitness and functioning;\u00a0People with disabilities: have a permanent impairment of structure or function and a related difficulty with activity or participation.
